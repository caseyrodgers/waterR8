We currently have 2 databases.  One for production that my Beta site is going to and then a test database that I'm using for all of my testing.  The web addresses are:

wr8.definium.net - Production
wr8-test.definium.net    - Test

These web pages are open and you can browse them.

To access the database through ssh, definium.net port 40000

You can login with steve: rotor

We have 3 databases; waterr8 is the production, waterr8_test is the test, and wr8-mfg is my manufacturing database where I'm pulling my radio serial numbers.

You can log in to these and see how they are set up.

I'll also send you the mockup pages from before.  Remember that these we just quick mockups and not necessarily what we really want or need.  That all still needs to be defined.
